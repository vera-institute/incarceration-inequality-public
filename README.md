# Incarceration and Inequality Public Data

## Background
Involvement in the criminal legal system has a profound and persistent impact on the well-being of people who are directly affected and their loved ones, undercutting economic opportunity and trapping families and children in poverty. With almost 2 million people behind bars on any given day, mass incarceration is a primary driver of disparities in wealth and income, yet—until now—we have not had the tools to track its impact on communities around the country.

Building on Vera’s [existing research and data projects](https://www.vera.org/solutions-research?token=AHBBTJdTH1tzvVJTDjpx35ITy9XH3p9Q), the Incarceration and Inequality Project team is working to compile and analyze data that illuminates the nexus of inequality and incarceration as a national research and policy priority.

The team’s priorities include conducting research and constructing datasets that describe the connections between incarceration and economic outcomes, developing an online visualization tool that can be used by wide-ranging audiences to elucidate these connections, and designing materials to increase awareness and inform policy responses.

## Data
The dataset is split into a series of tables that are organized into two high-level folders containing all state-level and all county-level tables. From there, the data is split into smaller tables based around thematic categories. Each table contains the necessary variables for joining across all tables (year and county or state fips code). 

An additional [table]() contains detailed variable descriptions, which includes the variable definition, data source, time period of data availability, and other summary statistics.
